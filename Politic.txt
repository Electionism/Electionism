Life Guard: I don't know, go play in the sand or something!
Patrick: Well, I don't know. Playing with the sand sounds pretty boring.
SpongeBob: Nonsense, Patrick. There are plenty of fun things to do in the sand. We can draw, or practice our cursive writing, or...

Fellow armsmen, I ask you
Will you follow me tonight to break their spine
and reclaim what once was mine?
Those cravens, backstabbed me, deceived me
Never shall I tolerate their crimes again
Now let the hunt begin. (Yeah!)
Seven thousands souls, scared and daunted, such a tale of woe
Not too long ago, this village was a golden scene of hope
Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace; restore our gloria
To live forever. (Yeah!)
Bring down the dark regime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order
I am the Lightbringer! (Yeah!)
I am the Lightbringer!
Now listen, fellow warriors, I ask you
Should my campaign come to an end?
There's way more to avenge. (Woah!)
Fifteen million souls, living in this realm without much hope
Not too long ago, this kingdom was a golden state of hope
(Yeah! Ah, ah, ah, ah, oh!)
Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace; restore our gloria
To live forever. (Yeah!)
Bring down the dark regime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order
I am the Lightbringer!
(Woah!) Call down the reckoning
Bring back hope and peace; restore our gloria
To live forever
Call down the reckoning
To bring back hope and peace; restore our gloria
To live forever!
Bring down the dark regime
I know how to unleash eternal power
Lead us to order!
I am the Lightbringer!
